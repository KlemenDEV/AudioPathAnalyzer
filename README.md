# Audio path analyzer

This project aims to develop an audio analyzer for analyzing audio transport path quality using criteria such as:
* First-order frequency response
* Harmonic distortion properties

It is written for Linux ALSA audio subsystem, so ALSA-dev is required for building:

`apt install libasound2-dev`

This project is still very work in progress.
